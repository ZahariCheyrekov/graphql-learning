# GraphQL Learning

This repository is dedicated to my GraphQL learning journey. It's a hands-on approach to understanding GraphQL, a powerful query language for APIs, and a server-side runtime for executing those queries using a type system defined for your data. This project was inspired by one YouTube video. You can view it for yourself here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yqWzCV0kU_c.
